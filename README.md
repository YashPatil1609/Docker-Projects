# Docker Projects Repository

Welcome to my Docker Projects repository! This collection showcases various Dockerized applications and use cases I’ve worked on, highlighting my skills in containerization and DevOps workflows.

### Disclamer: 
What i must mention is that i have not coded the applications myself but i do have a good understanding of each application's architecture and how it works. They are sourced from open-source projects or tutorials to showcase the process of containerizing existing applications.

This repository includes a variety of Docker projects, each designed to demonstrate different aspects of containerization, microservices, and application deployment. Explore the individual projects to learn more about their functionality and how they were built.

## I have:

- Containerized the applications by writing custom Dockerfiles and Compose files.
- Designed and implemented the containerized architecture.
- Gained a strong understanding of each application’s functionality and architecture.
- This repository reflects my expertise in Docker and containerization, rather than application development.
