# Nginx Load Balancer with Node.js Application

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Nginx** as a load balancer to distribute traffic across three upstream Docker containers running a Node.js application. The architecture ensures efficient traffic handling, scalability, and fault tolerance.

## Quick Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YashPatil1609/Docker-Projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd Nginx-NodeJs-Application
   ```

3. **Run the Docker containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```


4. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`. The Nginx server will balance the traffic among the Node.js instances using the default round robin algorithm.
